# Monitoring API rate limits
# Most API are rate limited, which means there's a limit to how many requests you can make in a certain
# amount of time. To see if you're approaching GitHub's limits, enter https://api.github.com/rate_limit. 
# The information weâ€™re interested in is the rate limit for the search API.

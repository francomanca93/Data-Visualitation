In this file i'm going to write the steps to create a repository for first time.

1. Create a repository in github. In this repository github will be added the .git directory
and README.md file.

2. Open VSCode and clone the repository where you want.

3. Crate a virtual enviroment to add all of dependence for your project. How will you do?

a----> virtualenv env --python=python3
b----> source env/bin/activate 
.b to deactivate you will write----> deactivate
c - Install all dependence that you will need or remember. Example ----> pip install matplotlib

4. Create a .gitignore file to ignore the "env" directory because 
it's a waste of space to the repo add this directory. How will you do?

a----> touch .gitignore
b - add all names of files or directories that you want or need ignore writing the .gitignore file
Example ---> env/ 

5. Create the requirement.txt file to write it with all names of dependence. How will you do?

a ----> pip freeze  <---- To know the name of dependence you will install. 
b ----> pip freeze > requirement.txt <---- To add the name of all dependence you will have.

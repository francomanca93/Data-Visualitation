### data-visualization folder
In this folder I learned to generate data sets and create visualization of that data.

There are three folders more that I will explain it.

1. The folder **plot_a_line_graph**:
    - I created simple plots with Matplotlib.
    - Contain two python scripts.
    
2. The folder **random_walks**:
    - I used a scatter plot to explore random walks.
    - Contain two python files.
        - *random_walk.py* is a class that I used to generate data for a random walks.
        - *randomWalk_visual.py* is a script that I used Matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of data genereted in random walk.

3. The folder **rolling_dice_with_Plotly**:
    - I created a histogram with Plotly and used it to explore the results of rolling dice of different sizes.
    - Contain two python files.
        - *die. py* is a class that it represent a simple die. 
        - *die_visual.py* is a script to create a visually histogram.

### downloading-data folder
In this folder I learned to work with different data sets extensions, csv and json
There are two folders with python scripts to work with csv and json files.

In this folder I learned to generate data sets and create visualization of that data.

There are three folder more that I will explain it.

    - I created simple plots with Matplotlib.
    - Contain three files. One jupyter notebook files and two python scripts.
    
2. The folder **random_walks**:
    - I used a scatter plot to explore random walks.
    - Contain two python files.
        - *random_walk.py* is a class that I used to generate data for a random walks.
        - *randomWalk_visual.py* is a script that I used Matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of data genereted in random walk.

3. The folder **rolling_dice_with_Plotly**:
    - I created a histogram with Plotly and used it to explore the results of rolling dice of different sizes.
    - Contain two python files.
        - *die. py* is a class that it represent a simple die.
